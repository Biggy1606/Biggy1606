### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning `Next.js` 😰.
- ⚡ I feel fluent in `Javascript` and `Typescript`
- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects where connets to db and displays data 🙄
- 🎪 Fun fact: I like work with `PLCs` 😮 (mostly `Siemens S7`) and integrate them with web techologies. _It's not easy, though_

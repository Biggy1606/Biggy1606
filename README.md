## Hi there 👋
### I'am mostly active on my gitea!
I placed here repositories from school tasks and projects that I think are worth publishing here.
### By the way:
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Next.js, which is quite challenging! 😅
- ⚡ I feel fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on projects that connect to databases and display data. 🤓
- 🎪 Fun fact: I enjoy working with PLCs 🤖 (mostly Siemens S7) and integrating them with web technologies. However, it's no simple task! 💪

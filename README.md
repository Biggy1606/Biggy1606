### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning `React`, `Typescript`, `C#`. Most difficult is `C#` for me.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects at work that are `super classified` ğŸ¤£
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like work with `PLCs` ğŸ˜® (mostly `Siemens S7`) and integrate them with web techologies
